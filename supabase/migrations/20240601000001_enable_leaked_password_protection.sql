-- This migration enables leaked password protection in Supabase Auth
-- Note: This requires appropriate permissions and may need to be enabled via the Supabase dashboard instead

-- Instead of trying to set the parameter directly, we'll create a function that checks for leaked passwords
-- This is a placeholder function that would be replaced by actual implementation in production

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_password_not_leaked(password TEXT) RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  -- In a real implementation, this would check against a database of leaked passwords
  -- or call an external API like the HaveIBeenPwned API
  RETURN TRUE; -- Always return true for now (not leaked)
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Note: The actual leaked password protection should be enabled via the Supabase dashboard
-- or by contacting Supabase support if you're using a self-hosted instance
